Ultimate Tic Tac toe
=================

Rules are very well explained here: http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/

**Note** I did not expect so many people to actually read the code, I apologize in advance as 
I hacked it together pretty fast, Also ignore the non-functional AI for now, but feel free to add/redo 
any part you like. I will accept merge requests. Thanks. :)
